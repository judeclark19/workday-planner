# Workday Planner

## Description
This single-service page shows you text blocks representing the hours between 9am and 5pm. The blocks are color coded to represent the current time.

You can type anything you wish into each block and click the save icon next to it to make the text persist on the page. Use this planner to write down notes for your upcoming day.
